# Deep Learning Paper Implementations

Implements deep learning papers. It contains basic papers such as activations, CNNs to advanced papers such as encoder-decoder etc.

It also contains the paper from which I learnt. Also a short summary of how this paper was important and contributed towards DL.

My Aim is to learn to write research code and easily reproduce it from papers.

# Why this Repo ?
- It presents easily reusable code for Deep Learning Papers.
- It contains ```*.py``` and easy to reproduce code.
- It becomes harder for people to open ```*.ipynb``` files and decode stuff and reuse from them. I have created functions and classes which is best practice of writing code.
- Code is written in Pytorch so that most community can benefit.
- Contributions for tensorflow code are welcome.

# What this repo is not for ?
- It is not a repo to showcase my DL skills or show off any implementations.
- Not to beat and achieve benchmarks.
- Not a repo to prove points how one paper is better than other. It depends on context where you apply DL. You won't fit a neural network when decision tree might work.
- Not a repo to showcase how papers keep battling for SOTA. I want to reimplement stuff not create a benchmarking repo.

# FAQs
## Can I copy paste some of your code from here ?
- Yes you can. It is just reimplementation. But I do not guarentee if that will help you to get SOTA.

## I found a bug what to do ?
- Raise a PR

## I want to contribute with some implementation?
- Document and comment the code well. Raise a PR.

## Can I use Fastai, or Keras to contribute?
- No, please do not for this repo is not for such frameworks that have too much built in power.
